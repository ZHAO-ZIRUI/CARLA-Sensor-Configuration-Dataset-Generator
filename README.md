# CARLA Sensor Configuration Iterator

**VERSION: 0.1.0**

The CARLA Sensor Configuration Iterator is an open-source programme that allows you to generate a [CARLA Simulator](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla) dataset that is based on a sensor configuration file specified by the user. 

## Processes and Trials

The application takes a set of sensor configuratiom inputs from a file as YAML format, decodes them into a job sequence, performs a trial and finally generates a dataset that matches the sensor configuratiom description. The process is shown in the diagram below:

At the start of each randomised trial, a coordinates in `x-y panel` will be generated by the following pattern:

1. Generate random value `x` in `[-r_max, r_max]`
2. Generate random value `r` in `[r_min, r_max]`
3. Calculate the value of `y` from the equation of the circle
4. Randomly take the sign for `y`

And now generate the `Transform` for the target:

1. Generate random value `yaw` in `[0.0, 360.0]`
2. Combine these variables to final transform: `(x, y, 0, 0, yaw, 0)`

The following diagram illustrates the process and the terminology used:

## Install

1. Decompression self-built CARLA Simulator to `{CARLA_ROOT}`
   
   > `{CARLA_ROOT}` is the root directory of **CARLA Simulator**. You can define this directory yourself. In the following, please replace the keyword with the appropriate directory.

2. Clone or Decompression this programme to `{APP_ROOT}`

    > `{APP_ROOT}` is the root directory of **this application**. You can define this directory yourself. In the following, please replace the keyword with the appropriate directory.

3. **(OPTIONAL)** Create and activate virutal Python environment
   
    ```
    # Create virtual environment
    $ cd {APP_ROOT}
    $ python -m venv ./venv

    # [Windows+Powershell] Activate venv
    $ .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

    # [Windwos+CMD] Activate venv
    $ .\venv\Scripts\activate.bat

    # [Linux] Activate venv
    $ source ./venv/bin/activate

    ```

4. Install requirements Python packages
   
    ```
    # Install public packages
    $ pip install -r ./requirements.txt

    # [Windows] Install carla python packages
    $ pip install {CARLA_ROOT}\PythonAPI\carla\dist\carla-0.9.13-cp38-cp38-win_amd64.whl

    # [Linux] Install carla python packages
    $ pip install {CARLA_ROOT}/PythonAPI/carla/dist/carla-0.9.13-cp38-p38-liunux_x86_64_whl
    ```

    > **⚠ WARN:** You must use the `.whl` package included in the CARLA distribution we provide, otherwise an unknown error may be raised!

## Start

The programme contains two sets of demos. One is provided as a pre-coded argument (Arugument: `--demo`) and the other is a set of sensor configuration files (File: `./input/demo_config_*.yaml`). This means that you can run the programme directly and try to [set up the sensor configuration files](#sensor-configuration-files) later.

1. Start CARLA Simulator and keep it on at all times.
   
    > **⚠ WARN:** The programme will automatically reset and set up CARLA world, please do not run other CARLA clients during the whole process.

    ```
    $ cd {CARLA_ROOT}

    # [Windows]
    # You can also open it directly by double-clicking on it using the Windows GUI.
    $ .\CarlaUE4.exe

    # [Linux]
    $ ./CarlaUE4.sh
    ```

2. **(OPTIONAL/DEMO)** Startup pre-coded demo:

    ```
    $ python ./main.py --demo
    ```

3. Startup configuration file demo:
   
    ```
    $ python ./main.py -c 20
    ```
    > Argument `-c 20` means that the programme will execute `20` trials with random target position in one configuration file. ([More details](#arguments))

If everything is all right, you will not see any log of the ERROR level in the system standard output. And in the output folder (`{./output/}`), you will see the following file structure.

```
output
 ├─demo_config_1  # Result from config file demo (demo_config_1.yaml)
 │  ├─0           # The first sensor in the list of yaml files 
 │  └─1           # The sencond sensor in the list of yaml files
 ├─demo_config_2  # Result from config file demo (demo_config_2.yaml)
 │  ├─0

     │  ├─...
     │  └─143.ply

        ├─123.csv  # radar -> csv result
        ├─...
        └─143.csv  
```


## Sensor Configuration Files

The sensor configuration file is encoded in [YAML format](https://yaml.org/). A single `.yaml` file represents a set of sensor settings in this programme. And the programme also supports multiple config inputs, iterating through all the `.yaml` files in the input folder.

A sensor configuration file looks like:

```
-
 blueprint_name: 'sensor.camera.rgb'
 transform:
  x: 0.8
  y: 0.0
  z: 1.8
  pitch: 0.0
  yaw: 0.0
  roll: 0.0
 attribute:
  image_size_x: 1920
  image_size_y: 1920
```
> You can find the full example configuration file [here](./input/demo_config_1.yaml)

The sensor configuration file is encoded as follows structure:

| Level | Data / Name    | Type    | Requried | Description                            |
|-------|----------------|---------|----------|----------------------------------------|
| 0     | -              | list    | TRUE     | Element identifiers in the root list   |
| 1     | blueprint_name | str     | TRUE     | Sensor blueprint name defined by CARLA |
| 1     | transform      | dict    | TRUE     | Sensor transform defined by CARLA      |
| 2     | x              | num     | TRUE     | transform - location - x               |
| 2     | y              | num     | TRUE     | transform - location - y               |
| 2     | z              | num     | TRUE     | transform - location - z               |
| 2     | pitch          | num     | TRUE     | transform - rotation - pitch           |
| 2     | yaw            | num     | TRUE     | transform - rotation - yaw             |
| 2     | roll           | num     | TRUE     | transform - rotation - roll            |
| 1     | attribute      | dict    | TRUE     | Sensor attributes dictionary           |
| 2     |                |         |          | Attribute elements can be NULL         |
| 2     | image_size_x   | num/str | FALSE    | Sensor attribute node defined by CARLA |

## Arguments

Programme can control behaviour by adding startup arguments, such as running examples (`--demo`) or displaying help (`-h` or `--help`).

You can try the following code to access the arguments help screen:

```
$ python ./main.py -h
```

If you need to change the default values of the arguments, you can found them at `./runtime.py`

> **⚠ WARN:** This operation is risky and may result in unknown errors!

## Adjustments

Due to the different configurations of the hardware devices running the CARLA simulator, in some cases it may be necessary to adjust the startup arguments of this programme to ensure correct and efficient data acquisition.

```
$ python ./main.py -d 1.0
```

The argument `-d 1.0` or `--delta-t 1.0` means the time difference between two random trails is `1.0` sec. The principle and adjustment method is shown in the diagram below.
