## Setup Scenarios

In this program, the scenario determines the source of the data set collection, and the scenario consists of two specific parts:

- **LOG FILE** is the scene record generated by the CARLA simulator, this file is usually generated using the python script at `<CARLA_ROOT>/PythonAPI/example/start_recording.py`, please refer to the official [CARLA documentation](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/adv_recorder/#recorder) for details
- **CONFIG FILE:**  is a file encoded in [YAML format](https://yaml.org/) to describe and define the scenarios in the log file. You can find config file at `<APP_ROOT>/scenario.yaml`. You should note that each log file needs to be defined in the config file before it can be used in the program. 

When you have completed the configuration of the above two files, the program will automatically execute all the scenarios defined in the configuration file for dataset generation.

### Config File

A scenario config file looks like:

```
- 
 name: 'demo_scenario_1'
 record_file: './scenarios/demo1.log'
 ego_vehicle_actor_id: 84
 time:
  start: 5
  end: 38
```
> You can find the full example config file [here](./scenario.yaml)

The sensor config file is encoded as follows structure:

| Level | Data / Name          | Type | Requried | Description                          |
|-------|----------------------|------|----------|--------------------------------------|
| 0     | -                    | list | TRUE     | Element identifiers in the root list |
| 1     | name                 | str  | TRUE     | Scenario name defined by yourself    |
| 1     | recird_file          | str  | TRUE     | Path to scenario log file            |
| 1     | ego_vehicle_actor_id | num  | TRUE     | Target vehicle id in scenario        |
| 1     | time                 | dict | TRUE     | Scenario boundaries in game seconds  |
| 2     | start                | num  | TRUE     | Scenario start time                  |
| 2     | end                  | num  | TRUE     | Scenario start time                  |
